# Chopra-Yatharth-A3-Game
Assignment 3 2D Game Project
This game is a clone of the game Breakout with a twist.
So the user has to destroy the vertically oscillating boxes with the help of the ball by pressing WASD keys on the keyboard and controlling the paddle with the help of mouse.
Once the user has destroyed all the boxes on the screen, they would simply win and can check how much time did they take to win.
Else, if the user let's the ball drop to the surface, they would simply lose the game.
